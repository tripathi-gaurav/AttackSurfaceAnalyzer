## Overview

Attack Surface Analyzer is a Microsoft-developed open source security tool that analyzes the attack 
surface of a target system and reports on potential security vulnerabilities introduced during
the installation of software or system misconfiguration. 

Attack Surface Analyzer 2 replaces the original [Attack Surface Analyzer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=24487) tool, released publicly in 2012.

Potential users of Attack Surface Analyzer include:

* DevOps Engineers - View changes to the system attack surface introduced when your software is installed.
* IT Security Auditors - Evaluate risk presented by when third-party software is installed.

## Core Features

The core feature of Attack Surface Analyzer is the ability to "diff" an operating system's security configuration, before and after a software component is installed and to run arbitrary complex rules on the results to surface interesting findings. This is important because most installation processes require elevated privileges, and once granted, can lead to unintended system configuration changes.

Attack Surface Analyzer currently reports on changes to the following operating system components:

- File system (static snapshot and live monitoring available)
- User accounts
- Services
- Network Ports
- Certificates
- Registry
- COM Objects
- Event Logs
- Firewall Settings

All data collected is stored in a set of local SQLite databases.

## How to Use Attack Surface Analyzer

Run the following commands in an Administrator Shell (or as root).  Replace ```asa``` with ```asa.exe``` as appropriate for your platform.

### CLI Mode
To start a default all collectors run: ```asa collect -a```

To compare the last two collection runs: ```asa export-collect```

For other commands run: ```asa --help```

### GUI Mode
For the GUI interface run: ```asa gui``` and a browser window should open directed at ```http://localhost:5000``` with the web based interface.
